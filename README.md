# I35W-Crash-Prediction-And-Analysis

This project attempts to predict if a vehicle accident occurs each day on a specific section of Interstate 35 West between Corral City and Denton.

## Methodology
Using a random forest model, many factors are accounted for including weather conditions, specific date, and more.

## Results
While our model did not have great success predicting whether a crash would occur, it was able to identify high risk days as well as identify factors that were most influential in causing crashes. Unexpectedly, they were wind direction, moon phase, and wind gust speeds.
